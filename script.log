Do you want to check the quality of your data? (yes/no): Do you want to trim your data? (yes/no): You have opted not to trim your data.
Please ensure your data is of good quality or already trimmed before proceeding.
For further analysis, make sure that the data is located in the ./data/trimmed_fastq directory.
For annotation, do you want to use (e)nsembl or (r)efseq? (e/r): After Salmon is done, do you want to analyze your data? (yes/no): Please enter the transcript ID(s) of interest in NM format (e.g., NM_020984.4).
If multiple IDs are to be searched for, separate them with space: 
You have selected the following options:
  - Check quality of data: no
  - Trim data: no
  - Database for annotation: RefSeq
  - Analyze data: yes
  - Transcript IDs: NM_000021.4
Do you wish to continue with these settings? (yes/no): Configuration complete. Proceeding with the script...
